# better-turtle

A TypeScript port of the famous Turtle JS project.

#### üìî Complete documentation -> [**Here**](https://caesarovich.github.io/better-turtle/)

## üê¢ What is BetterTurtle ?

Turtle JS is a **graphic library** based on the [LOGO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>) programming language aimed towards education.
It allows JavaScript beginners to handle programming in a very graphic way,
**every action is rendered visually**,
making it easy to understand the principles of programming.
BetterTurtle is an improved version of the many existing ones into TypeScript.

## üì• Installation

### Option 1 - Include in a HTML script tag

You can directly include a **minified** (_No IntelliSense_) version of the code into your HTML page.

```html
<script src="https://github.com/Caesarovich/better-turtle/releases/download/v1.4.0/main.min.js"></script>
```

### Option 2 - Install from NPM

```sh
npm install --save better-turtle
```

### Option 3 - Clone and build from source

```sh
# Clone the repo in your project directory
git clone https://github.com/Caesarovich/better-turtle

# Build the library
cd "better-turtle" && npm i && npm run build

# Then install it to your project

## 1 - Browser
npm exec webpack && mv dist/main.min.js ../turtle.min.js

## 2 - NPM
cd ../ && npm install better-turtle
```

## ‚åõ Quickstart

### In browser

```js
const { Turtle } = BetterTurtle;

// Get an HTML Canvas element
const canvas = document.getElementById('my-canvas-element-id');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Instanciate a new Turtle
const tur = new Turtle(ctx);

tur.goto(-350, 0).forward(60).left(50).forward(300);
```

### NodeJS

```js
import { createCanvas } from 'canvas';
import { Turtle } from 'better-turtle';

const canvas = createCanvas(400, 400);
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

const turtle = new Turtle(ctx);

turtle.forward(100).right(90).forward(50);
```

## üîó Exposing methods

Using the `.expose` method, it is possible to **expose a Turtle instance's methods onto a JavaScript Object**. It is particularly useful when using it with a **global object** such as the `window` object in browsers.

> **Note:** It is possible to remap the methods with the optionnal parameter. Further details in the docs üìî

```js
const turtle = new Turtle(ctx);

turtle.expose(window);

// ...

forward(50);
right(120);
setColor('red');
forward(150);
hide();
```

## ‚è≤Ô∏è Events

The Turtle class **extends** the [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-event-emitter) Class. Allowing you to listen to events such as `'step'` or `'forward'` when the turtle is in [StepByStep](https://caesarovich.github.io/better-turtle/classes/Turtle.html#stepByStep) Mode.

```js
const turtle = new Turtle(ctx);

turtle.on('step', (step) => {
  console.log(`The turtle has done an action: ${step}`);
});

turtle.forward(120).left(90).forward(30).right(90);
```

In this exemple, every action will be logged in the console.
